# AOC2023

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023, written entirely in Julia

```
Note: unfortunately I fell incredibly ill following a flight back home on day 10 :(
I'd like to come back to this with some new Julia integrations I've seen for Vim
```

## Usage

Run code for solutions to problems for the selected day
```bash
$ julia --project=. run.jl <day>
```

Run tests
```bash
$ julia --project=. test/runtests.jl [day]
```
